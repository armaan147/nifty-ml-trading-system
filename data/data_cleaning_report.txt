Data Cleaning Summary

The raw intraday NIFTY price data was reviewed and processed before being used for
feature engineering and strategy analysis.

Steps performed during cleaning:

1. Duplicate rows were checked and removed where found.
2. Missing values in price columns were handled using forward filling to preserve
   time continuity.
3. Rows with invalid or non-numeric price values were identified and dropped.
4. Timestamp order was verified to ensure correct chronological sequencing.
5. Basic sanity checks were performed on price fields to ensure no negative or zero
   prices were present.

After cleaning, the dataset was suitable for feature construction and downstream
analysis. No aggressive filtering was applied in order to retain as much information
as possible from the original data.

This cleaning approach was chosen to balance data quality with realism, acknowledging
the limitations of free intraday data sources.
